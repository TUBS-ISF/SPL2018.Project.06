== Application
=== Domain
The topic is about a Japanese language trainer with the working title "Hirakanaji".
In this application the user will be able to learn the basic Japanese vocabulary and syllabaries (Hiragana and Katakana).
Other possible modes may be e.g. some syllable scrambler for practicing your memory and writing skills or a daily vocabulary trainer.
The basic idea for the domain is from https://github.com/dmitrij-drandarov/Hiragana-Scrambler[here].

=== Feature Model
==== Overview
==== Configurations
* `*default*` Basic web-application without gamification and export functionalities
* `*config1*` Local CLI application with basic Romaji scrambler functionality
* `*config2*` Local CLI application with basic Hiragana scrambler functionality
* `*config3*` Local CLI application with basic Katakana scrambler functionality
* `*config4*` Web-application with full scrambler functionality
* `*config5*` Pro web-application with all functionalities

== Progress
* [x] 1 Dom채nenanalyse
    ** [x] Choose domain for project -> Japanese Language Trainer
    ** [x] Create feature diagram
        *** [x] English language
        *** [x] Only alphabetical characters
        *** [x] Every feature may have a short description
        *** [x] Add constraints
        *** [x] Create five configurations
    ** [x] Write short introduction to the domain
    ** [x] Init project
        *** [x] (Use Gradle)
        *** [x] Set up FeatureIDE project (Composer: Feature Modeling)
        *** [x] Every project should be inside a separate sub project

== Ideas
* Import Japanese-English vocabulary file
* Dictionary with search function
